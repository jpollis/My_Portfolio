      <p id="bio" class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">A developer friend of mine told me one day, that I should really try this coding thing. So one evening, I logged on to a free "teach yourself programming sites", and I never looked back. I remember that first night, I solved my first challenge, and I felt a sense of fulfillment that I had never felt in my previous career. It was that sense of purpose that I was really missing. So, I decided after a couple months, to go all in! I made the decision to attend Wyncode Academy, a bootcamp that focuses on teaching Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p id="bio-2">During my time at wyncode, I gained fundamental knowledge and full-stack experience through building web applications from start to finish. Using Agile principles in a team and solo environment, I contributed on both front end and back end technologies on several projects. For my final project, I was awarded the opportunity to work for local Miami startup, "Homz Direct". A mobile web app that delivers a social media-esque user experience for home buyers.</p>
      <p id="bio-3">I am excited to continue learning and growing with this passion of mine, and become a well rounded developer. My goal is to enjoy what I do and never stop learning!</p>
